Hello! I am currently a visiting student researcher in the [Causality in Cognition Lab](https://cicl.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), researching computational models of counterfactual inference with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/). We are studying how humans combine observational and interventional data from populations to make decisions themselves, and how to model these cognitive processes through causal networks and simulations. 

I have also joined [Lautonomy](https://lautonomy.com/) as CTO to develop a platform to supercharge human rights and environmental law protection, removing the complexity that systemically blocks fair and equitable access to law. Currently, we are building a legal knowledge graph using international laws and treaties in partnership with [Freedom From Torture](https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/) and [The AIRE Centre](https://www.airecentre.org/) to improve redress and access to legal representation for torture survivors and asylum seekers.

I completed my BSc. at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) studying [Cognitive Systems](https://cogsys.ubc.ca/) with a focus in Computational Intelligence and Design, directed by the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). I've spent time at the [WiNMoS Lab](http://winmos.ece.ubc.ca/Welcome_to_WiNMoS) with [Yanjie Dong](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~ydong16/index.html) doing research in <strong>decentralized reinforcement learning</strong>. I've also worked with [Matthew Cooke](https://matthewcooke.ca/) at [Snyder Lab](http://snyderlab.com/) on <strong>scientific software development and data analysis</strong> for behavioural neuroscience.

Previously, I developed a novel framework for <strong>unsupervised anomalous object detection</strong> at [RecyclEye](https://recycleye.com/). At [Algomo](https://www.algomo.com/), I created an interactive model-understanding and evaluation platform for chatbot data and feedback, and invented a brand-new method for <strong>named entity recognition</strong> using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/). 

<strong>Research interests:</strong>
- Generative deep learning models
- Self-supervised and semi-supervised learning 
- Causal reasoning and its effects on interpretability and generalization
- Causal learning and inference in neural networks and time-series models
- ML and AI for social good
