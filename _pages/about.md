Hello! I am currently a machine learning engineer at [Rebel Space Technologies](https://www.rebelspacetechnologies.com/) building tech that enables autonomous, ad-hoc wireless connectivity in dynamic environments for mission-critical operations - come check us out!

I also collaborate closely with [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/) at [Stanford's Causality in Cognition Lab](https://cicl.stanford.edu/), researching computational models of counterfactual inference. We are studying how humans combine observational and interventional data from populations to make decisions themselves, and how to model these cognitive processes through causal networks and simulations. 

In my free time, I am developing a platform to supercharge human rights and environmental law protection at [Lautonomy](https://lautonomy.com/). My co-founder and I hope to improve redress and access to legal representation for torture survivors and asylum seekers by removing the complexity that systemically blocks fair and equitable access to law.

I completed my BSc. at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) studying [Cognitive Systems](https://cogsys.ubc.ca/) with a focus in Computational Intelligence and Design, directed by the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). I've spent time at the [WiNMoS Lab](http://winmos.ece.ubc.ca/Welcome_to_WiNMoS) with [Yanjie Dong](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~ydong16/index.html) doing research in <strong>decentralized reinforcement learning</strong>. I've also worked with [Matthew Cooke](https://matthewcooke.ca/) at [Snyder Lab](http://snyderlab.com/) on <strong>scientific software development and data analysis</strong> for behavioural neuroscience.

Previously, I developed a novel framework for unsupervised anomalous object detection at [RecyclEye](https://recycleye.com/). At [Algomo](https://www.algomo.com/), I created an interactive model-understanding and evaluation platform for chatbot data and feedback, and invented a brand-new method for <strong>named entity recognition</strong> using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/). 

<strong>Research interests:</strong>
- Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
- Self-supervised and semi-supervised learning 
- Causal reasoning and its effects on interpretability and generalization
- Causal learning and inference in neural networks and time-series models
- ML and AI for social good
