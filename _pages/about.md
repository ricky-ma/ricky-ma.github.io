I am a BSc. student in the [Cognitive Systems Program](https://cogsys.ubc.ca/) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), part of the Computational Intelligence and Design stream directed by the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). I've spent time at the [WiNMoS Lab](http://winmos.ece.ubc.ca/Welcome_to_WiNMoS) with [Yanjie Dong](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~ydong16/index.html) doing research in <strong>decentralized reinforcement learning</strong>. I've also worked with [Matthew Cooke](https://matthewcooke.ca/) at [Snyder Lab](http://snyderlab.com/) on <strong>scientific software development and data analysis</strong> for behavioural neuroscience.

At [RecyclEye](https://recycleye.com/), I developed a novel framework for <strong>unsupervised anomalous object detection</strong> using state-of-the-art deep convolutional autoencoders. At [Algomo](https://www.algomo.com/), I created an interactive model-understanding and evaluation platform for chatbot data and feedback, and invented a brand new method for <strong>named entity recognition</strong> using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/). 

<strong>Research interests:</strong>
- Generative deep learning models
- Self-supervised and semi-supervised learning 
- Causal reasoning and its effects on interpretability and generalization
- Causal learning and inference in neural networks and time-series models
- ML and AI for social good
